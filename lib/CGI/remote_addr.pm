=head1 NAME

CGI::remote_addr - Enhanced version of CGI.pm's "remote_addr()"

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use CGI;
  use CGI::remote_addr;

  my $cgi  = CGI->new();
  my $addr = $cgi->remote_addr();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<CGI::remote_addr> implements an enhanced version of the C<remote_addr()>
method provided by C<CGI.pm>, which attempts to return the original IP address
that the connection originated from (which is not necessarily the IP address
that we received the connection from).

Simply loading C<CGI::remote_addr> causes it to over-ride the existing
C<remote_addr()> method.  Do note, though, that this is a global over-ride; if
you're running under mod_perl you've just over-ridden it for B<all> of your
applications.

=head2 Differences from CGI.pm

=over

=item *

We check not only C<$ENV{REMOTE_ADDR}> to find the IP address, but also look in
C<$ENV{HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR}> to find the IP address.  If
C<$ENV{HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR}> is defined, we try that first.

=item *

Only valid IP addresses are returned, regardless of whatever exists in
C<$ENV{REMOTE_ADDR}> or C<$ENV{HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR}>.  I've seen lots of cases
where the values for C<$ENV{HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR}> were stuffed with garbage,
and we make sure that you only get a real IP back.

=item *

We return IPs in both a scalar and a list context.  In scalar context you get
the first (originating) IP address.  In list context you get a unique list of
all of the IPs that the connection was received through.

=item *

In the event that we cannot find a valid IP address, this method returns
C<undef>, B<NOT> 127.0.0.1 (like C<CGI.pm> does).
